# DXD-Mobage
A full english translation for the Dxd Mobage game.

To be able to use it, you'll need [TamperMonkey for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) or [GreaseMonkey for Mozilla](https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/).

Once you have it, you just have to check the Raw page of [Dxd.user.js](https://github.com/Tracehunter/DXD-Mobage/raw/master/DxD.user.js).

Don't forget to update the script from time to time, I'm working on it !
